# Githublearn
This is me trying to learn how to use github.
I have been having a hard time to understand functions and classes.
I am a wee confused about parameters, arguments and how to use return in fucntions
On top of that, working with JSON files seems to be pain in the neck for me.
Hard to distinguish loads and load or dump and dumps. Reading and writing on the
files seems to come to me at a slower pace.

Today 30/05/2024 is practice day. I want to go through all these and find some
exercises to work on.

The second day of trying functions. I am reviewing the chapter about functions
from the book I am using to learn Python(Python Crash Course) and do some
exercises.
